## Git Workflow
- We will be pushing to seperate branches and merging pull requests by reviewing each others code.
- Create a new branch locally by running ```git checkout -b <branch name>```
- After changes are added and committed (please use proper commit messages) ```git commit -m "<message>"``` run  ```git push origin <branch name>```
- This will create a remote branch on the repository. Go to the repository and create a new pull request.
- Assign the other two contributors as reviewers and make sure you push your pull request to the  ```'devel'```  branch.
- May the code be with you !
